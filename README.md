# 🏠 House Price Prediction – Feature Engineering Comparison

This project investigates how different **feature engineering** methods impact the performance of a machine learning model for **house price prediction**.  
Using the same dataset, we compare three approaches:

### 🔧 1. Original Features + Manual Feature Engineering
Human-crafted features based on intuition and domain knowledge (e.g., ratios, interactions, transformations).

### 🤖 2. Original Features + FeatureTools (Automated Feature Engineering)
Automatically generated features using the **FeatureTools** library.

### 🚀 3. Original Features + AutoML-Generated Features
An AutoML pipeline that automatically creates, selects, and optimizes features.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To identify which approach provides the **best predictive performance** and evaluate how automated feature engineering compares to manual human-designed features in a real-world regression problem.
